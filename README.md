# WildFires
Machine and statical learning project about understanding what variables contribute to wildfires and how we might be able to predict them

Wildfire.pdf is a presentaion on the process of the project

Wildifre Final Report. pdf is a paper for more details on the project

Wildfrire coordinates.csv are the wildfire datapoints used in my modeling
